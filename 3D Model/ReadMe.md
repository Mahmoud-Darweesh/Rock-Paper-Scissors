# 3D Model

The Introduction:

  One of the things that excite me about this project is that I can morph it into many other ideas. One of these ideas is to transform my rock paper scissors game from only working on a computer to a mechanical arm that can move on its own. Although its first application would be to play a game, the possibilities for reforming its a more useful tool is endless. An example of that could be to make home appliances react to hand gestures not voice commands since deaf people can’t use voice commands.

The Setup: 

  First, after printing the model and assembling it we can use multiple servos to control the finger movements. This allows us to have control over each finger individually instead of moving a set of fingers together. Next we connect the servos to a raspberry pi or an arduino so that we wouldn’t have to have the project directly connect to our computer when we are done. Finally, we connect the python script to the microcontroller and plug in the camera.
